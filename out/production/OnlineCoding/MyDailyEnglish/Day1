My favourite is cooking, listening music and gardening however I always prefer gardening. Gardening is like meditation to me which
improves my work efficiency, interest and ability. It gives me high level of peace and makes my whole day useful. Every early morning
I enjoy my blooming garden, growing plants slowly on daily basis. I also enjoy sun rise and sun set daily in my garden.
I generally like to do my school home work in my evergreen garden.
